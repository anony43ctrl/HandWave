# HandWave: Gesture-Controlled Robotic Arm

**Overview**

This project involves the development of a robotic arm that is operated through hand gestures, utilizing the Robot Operating System (ROS) for control and coordination. By implementing computer vision techniques, the robotic arm responds to user hand movements without the need for physical touch, enhancing ease of interaction and usability. The system uses a camera to detect hand gestures and translates them into commands for the robotic arm, making it a highly intuitive and hands-free experience.

**Features**

Gesture-Based Control: Operates the robotic arm through hand gestures captured by a camera.

ROS Integration: Leverages the Robot Operating System (ROS) for smooth coordination and control of the robotic arm.

Computer Vision: Implements real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition for accurate arm movements.

Touchless Interaction: Enhances user experience by eliminating the need for physical touch or manual input.

Customizable Movements: Users can program various gestures to trigger specific movements or actions of the robotic arm.

**Technologies Used**

Robot Operating System (ROS): For robot control and communication.

OpenCV: For computer vision and hand gesture recognition.

TensorFlow/Keras: For training and implementing hand gesture recognition models (optional depending on the implementation).

Python: Programming language for system integration and logic.

Robot Arm Hardware: The robotic arm is equipped with servos and actuators, controlled through ROS commands.
